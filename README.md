# EVMSpec-VsCodeExtension README

VS.Code extension for syntax highlighting certora's specification files (.spec, .cvl).

Requires an extension for solidity to be already installed and enabled; tested with juanblanco.solidity from the marketplace.

Installation: 

Download zip from github, copy the whole EVMSpec-VsCodeExtension folder into:

 * Windows %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
 * macOS ~/.vscode/extensions
 * Linux ~/.vscode/extensions

Note this is a very early version, it is supposed to provide some basic syntax highlighting; the highlighting might be "off" in some places, more robust versions are still to come.
