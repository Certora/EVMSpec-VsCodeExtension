# evmspecforvscode README

VS.Code extension for syntax highlighting certora's specification files (.spec, .cvl).

Installation: 

Download zip from github, copy the whole EVMSpec-VsCodeExtension folder into:

 * Windows %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
 * macOS ~/.vscode/extensions
 * Linux ~/.vscode/extensions

Note this is a very early version, it is supposed to provide some basic syntax highlighting; the highlighting might be "off" in some places, more robust versions are still to come.
